# Generic Python Layout

..it's literally just that, this repository is a empty Python project layout structure..

It contains:

 - src directory for the Python library and/or application source files
 - tests directory for the tests that the library and/or application will be tested with
 - pyproject.toml that defines the setup for this layout
